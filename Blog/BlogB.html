        <div class="subtitle">3 steps to designing a website in 2022</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Let's go over 3 stages that you'll go through when designing a
          website:
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">1. Define your website’s scope and goals</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Whether you're designing a website for yourself or a client, it’s
          important to first clearly define the website's purpose and goals. All
          websites strive to deliver eye-catching design and a pleasant user
          experience, but they also need to reach (and grow) a target audience.
          At times, clients will come to you with their purpose, goals,
          objectives, branding, and content complete and ready to be implemented
          into a CMS (content management system). However, some clients will
          rely on your expertise to build a new site or redesign their current
          one. To define the goals and scope of a website and associated
          webpages, you need to know the why, the what, and the how behind it.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">Why should this website exist?</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Before designing a website, you need to know its primary purpose, so
          ask yourself — why should this website exist? For example, if you’re
          building an ecommerce website, the purpose would be to list products
          through an online store. If you’re designing a portfolio website, the
          purpose would be to showcase your work.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">What should this website achieve?</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Once you've defined your why (i.e. your website's purpose), you need
          to think about what you hope to achieve with this website. For
          instance, if you’re building an ecommerce website, the website should
          help you attract your target customers and convince them to purchase
          your products. For a portfolio website, the achievement might be
          getting a potential client to visit your contact page and fill out a
          contact form.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">
          How will the website serve its purpose and goals?
        </div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Once you know why your website should exist and what you hope it will
          accomplish, you can focus on how to turn those hopes into reality.
          It’s important to consider not just how you’ll get your target
          audience on your website, but also how you’ll keep them there. As you
          work through your design process, it’s important to consider best
          practices for website SEO (search engine optimization). Setting up
          your site so that various pages will rank well on Google is crucial if
          you want customers to be able to find you through search engines.
          Then, think about the entire user experience and visual presentation
          of your website — from the top of the page, through the headers, and
          all the way down to the footer. Your design needs to engage site
          visitors right away, and keep them happy with an intuitive navigation,
          fast loading time, and logical layout.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">2. Research and plan out content</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Once you have your why, what, and how, you can start planning out
          written and visual content that will keep website visitors engaged.
          Start by researching your competition. Browse their websites and see
          what you love (and what you don’t). Pay attention to the user
          interface (UI) and your user experience (UX). Skim their content to
          see what headings, visuals, or features catch your attention. Draw
          inspiration from current web design trends and galleries like Dribbble
          or Made in Webflow. Make note of design elements, wording, or content
          organization that you think could serve your audience well. After
          you've gathered your notes and insights from this research, create a
          mood board. If you’re working with existing images, a Pinterest board
          is a good option. However, if you want to dive into more detailed
          designs, a tool like Figma will serve you better. Mood boards are
          ideal in that they allow you to consolidate your findings and
          transform them into a more visual representation. They can serve as a
          foundation for when you build your brand’s identity.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">3. Design your brand identity</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Brand could refer to a company or personal brand. It encompasses both
          your visual identity — including color scheme, typography, logo
          design, and your website — along with your brand’s overall
          personality. If you’re designing the website for a company, they will
          likely have their own style and branding guidelines that dictate their
          brand identity including colors, fonts, logo variations, etc., which
          you can apply to the website design. But if you’re starting from
          scratch, there are some key elements to consider: color scheme,
          typography, imagery, and overall voice and tone.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">Color scheme</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Color has a profound impact on brand identity. Color meanings and
          psychology influence people’s perception of a brand based on color
          alone. Plus, background, life experience, and even what generation
          people are in influence color preferences. You can use this to your
          advantage. Think about what emotions you want people to associate with
          your brand. Consider what age groups you’d like to appeal to. Let
          these things guide you towards a color scheme. For example, if you
          want to come off as trustworthy and wise and hope to reach baby
          boomers, you could build a website color palette around navy or
          cerulean blue.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">Typography</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          Font, typeface, and typography are all related, but not
          interchangeable. Typefaces are like the parent — a set of glyphs or
          letters in a particular style. Fonts are like the kids, a variation of
          a typeface with a certain weight, or size. For example, Arial is a
          typeface while Arial Black (a bold, heavier version) is a font.
          Typography involves typefaces and fonts, but refers to the overall art
          and design of arranging text. Take these examples from Type Fan, for
          instance. Both websites use typographic design to really grab your
          attention.
        </div>

        <img
          src="image/63052bff1faffc3e953b67d2_DuAfMmxYT45AJmXacgdC70oqohWF1JW6665s8AucyZl8Q9TFJDCC4nlTkSRS-QCTVrCtu9Sk1yGKpVdFyAxz4Rk4q8TqKhW878pB9Mwx1YLkhHp6s5x7kuoZCyUoFGXFgSE-HLLSwzGEkBl7k.jpeg"
        />
        <div class="container-maintext">
          When used strategically, typography can be a strong indicator of a
          brand’s identity. If you explore Leandro Assis’s website, you’ll find
          that typography is central to his brand — which makes sense, since
          Leandro is a lettering artist. But you don’t have to be a lettering
          artist to use typography to your advantage. As you design a website,
          continuously take a step back (perhaps literally) to see how your text
          arrangement and design might look for a new site visitor. Is it
          exuding the mood and message you’re going for?
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">Imagery</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          You can’t complete a brand identity without visual elements. This
          includes the imagery you use on your website as well as brand assets
          for social media, advertising, etc. Imagery encompasses a wide variety
          of elements that come together on a website, including photography,
          illustrations, animations, and icons. You’ll use imagery alongside
          your other design elements, ensuring that it plays well with your
          color scheme and typography. The examples below show two different but
          effective uses of imagery.
        </div>

        <img src="image/63052e3e26d9632e73cc71eb_image3.jpg" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Bazil’s portfolio site and Shuuga website
        </figcaption>

        <div class="container-maintext">
          The top image shows Bazil’s portfolio homepage, which uses a black and
          white photo with a transparent background paired with oversized
          typography. This combination provides a professional but visually
          appealing first impression. Underneath, you can see the Shuuga
          website, which also uses oversized typography but in a much more
          playful and colorful font. Shuuga adds motion with a smiley-face
          cursor icon and enlarged photos of the candies sliding across the
          screen. Both websites are solid examples of making color, typography,
          and imagery work in harmony.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">Voice and tone</div>
        <div class="container-maintext">
          A brand’s voice draws from the company’s overall values and mission.
          Often, this breaks down into a set of characteristics and driving
          forces such as informative, relatable, and approachable people who
          want to spread positivity. Or, professional, technical, and precise
          experts who aim to deliver current, accurate information. Your voice
          is like your brand’s personality — it remains consistent and always
          represents the characteristics of your brand. Tone can change
          depending on the situation. For example, the tone of your social media
          posts might be funny and a little snarky at times. However, you
          wouldn’t want to bring any snark into the tone of your customer
          service emails. At Webflow, we define tone as “Audience + context +
          content = tone” You can review our voice and tone guidelines for more
          details about how we designed them. If you’re designing a website for
          a client, you probably won’t have to go too deep into what words
          represent the proper voice and tone, but you will need to ensure that
          the design matches. Going back to Bazil’s portfolio site and Shuuga —
          each website design gives you a first impression of each brand’s voice
          and tone. Looking at Bazil’s homepage, you can assume he is a
          professional who leans more towards clean, minimalist design with a
          friendly touch (hand wave emoji gives us a hint at Bazil’s
          personality). Shuuga, on the other hand, is likely into a more
          maximalist design with loud, playful touches.
