                In today’s fast-moving world, knowing Sass is an important part of web development. Today, almost all
                large projects use some sort of preprocessor like Sass, Less, Stylus, etc.

                Sass is the most popular and easy to use. If you learn Sass, it’s very easy to learn other
                preprocessors.
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">What Is Sass?</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                It stands for Syntantically Awesome Stylesheets. It’s a CSS preprocessor.

                It allows us to create variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and do mathematical calculations,
                allowing us to write next-generation CSS today. It allows us to easily manage large CSS files and split
                them across different files.

                Every CSS file is a Sass file. so you can take your .css file contents and put it in a Sass file and it
                will work just fine.

                There are two types of syntaxes while writing CSS in Sass.

                1. SASS: Files with the .sass extension allows us to write CSS without semicolons and without curly
                brackets with an added indentation for CSS properties.
            </div>
            <img src="image/Blog E-2.webp" id="container-img">
            <div class="container-maintext">
                2. SCSS: Files with the .scss extension is the CSS we normally write, where each CSS declaration ends
                with
                a semicolon and each selector is written in curly brackets.
            </div>
            <img src="image/Blog E-3.webp" id="container-img">
            <div class="container-maintext">
                The choice is up to you as to which syntax to use. We will be using the SCSS syntax.

                The great thing about Sass is that we write code in a .scss file and it will be converted to a CSS file
                using a tool we will explore later in this article. So, in the end, the browser will render only CSS
                files.

                Let’s understand what Sass provides.
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Variables</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                Sass allows us to declare variables. This is one of the areas where Sass shines because we can create
                variables for different colors or font sizes and use that variable in any file.

                So, if we want to change the color of any part of the page later, we don’t need to make changes in all
                places where the color is used. We just change the color in the variable and the change will be
                reflected in all the places where that color is used.

                To declare a variable in Sass, we start the variable name with a dollar sign.
            </div>
            <code>
                $background-color: #ff0000;
                $sm-font-size: 16px;
                $lg-font-size: 20px;
            </code>
            <div class="subtitle">Comments</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                Sass provides two ways of writing comments.

                1. Single-line comment: double slashes //.
                2.Multi-line comment: /* */.

                Note: Single-line comments will not be added to the final compiled CSS file. Only multi-line comments
                will be added to the final CSS. So, if you need to see the comments in a CSS file, you need to write it
                using the /* */ syntax
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Nesting</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                If you have CSS like below:
            </div>
            <code>
                footer {
                    background-color: #777;
                   }
                   footer ul {
                    list-style: none;
                   }
                   footer li {
                    float: left;
                   }
                   footer li a {
                    padding: 5px;
                    color: #4e4f48;
                    font-size: 16px;
                    text-decoration: none;
                   }
            </code>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                We can write it using nesting like this:
            </div>
            <code>
                footer {
                    background-color: #777;
                    ul {
                     list-style: none;
                    }
                    li {
                     float: left;
                     a {
                       padding: 5px;
                       color: #4e4f48;
                       font-size: 16px;
                       text-decoration: none;
                     }
                    }
                   }
            </code>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                So, as shown in the above CSS, nesting allows us to group together related code, which is easy to modify
                and maintain and also saves us from typing extra characters.
