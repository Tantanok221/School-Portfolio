            <div class="subtitle">In this article, you will learn why agencies are choosing Figma over Sketch.</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                There has been a constant debate on the internet surrounding Figma and Sketch. Web designers and web
                design agencies now want to know which one is better for UX/UI design, prototyping, team collaboration,
                and more.

                Martin LeBlanc, CEO of CellCarta, a global contract research agency says, “A user interface is like a
                joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.” Similarly, Neville Brody, Graphic Designer at
                Brody Associates, says, “Digital design is like painting, except the paint never dries.”

                Keeping these quotes in your peripheral view, you would want to keep up with the changing web design
                trends. Why? To ultimately serve your agency’s goal of delivering state-of-the-art, impactful websites
                to your clients. For this reason, as a web design agency, you should know which collaborative design
                tools you should choose and why!

                And to make this choice easier for you, I will give you a detailed overview of Figma and Sketch each
                with responses from relevant industry personnel on what they are using (Sketch or Figma) and why they
                choose one over another
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Why Are Designers Actively Switching From Sketch to Figma?</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                More and more designers are now switching from Sketch to Figma. People usually switch this actively when
                something is remarkably better and when switching is really simple and easy.

                In fact, by now you know that Sketch allows you to export files easily whilst Figma exports can be a lot
                more tricky. You should also know that Figma allows you to import Figma, Sketch, and other image files
                as soon as you get started. This gives an easy start to designers who switch from Sketch to Figma. They
                can start designing on the web as soon as they want.

                There are of course other reasons too that explain why designers are switching to Figma. A few of them
                are:

                1. Figma is an All-in-One Design Tool
                Figma is an all-in-one, complete design tool that possesses all that you need to design and collaborate,
                it even gives you its own FigJam whiteboard; whereas, Sketch uses plugins like Zeplin, InVision and
                Abstract to provide you functionalities like prototyping and developer handoff. Zeplin allows for
                collaborative UI/UX design, InVision provides a collaborative whiteboard, and Abstract is a design
                intelligence platform that also allows team collaboration.

            <div class="subtitle">2. Figma is a Browser-Based App</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">Figma is a browser-based app that allows you to create and design
                efficiently on the web. While on Sketch, you have to create and design on a Mac app that requires
                frequent version updates. This is tiresome and can create bad usability. According to ClickZ, “79% of
                users place the highest level of importance on the overall usability of a site or app.” .

                Moreover, with Sketch, you need to create all your designs on the Mac app and can only collaborate on
                the web when you export files for viewing, sharing, feedback, and commenting. While on Figma, everything
                happens at one place, which is on the web. So Figma is a lot simpler to use and hence the user
                experience is better.
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">3. Figma Allows for Better Collaboration and Teamwork</div>
            <div class="container-maintext">
                Something that’s not possible with Sketch is the flexibility to do everything at one place. With Figma,
                you can easily collaborate in real-time on the web by sharing design files.
            </div>

                Some web design agencies may question if Figma can really match the combined performance of Sketch,
                Zaplin, and InVision. To answer them, we will just say yes it can. Why? Because Figma makes design
                workflows much smoother by having all functionalities within. For e.g., it makes displaying your
                wireframes/designs much slicker because of its own prototyping feature. Moreover, working on Figma’s own
                FigJam whiteboard allows for a much smoother user experience than working with InVision or other
                prototyping softwares in Sketch.

                Moreover, it eliminates the need to download so many plugins to give you the functionalities that a
                design tool should have on its own to make everything run smoothly.

                Figma is a complete solution for everything from creating and collaborating on design files, to
                prototyping interactions, sharing links to the prototypes and files, gathering feedback through
                comments, and having access to all the code snippets and specs you need as a web design agency for web
                development.
